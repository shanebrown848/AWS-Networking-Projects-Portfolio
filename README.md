# AWS Networking Projects Portfolio

This repository contains a structured collection of hands-on AWS networking projects completed through the **NextWork** learning series. These projects demonstrate real-world cloud networking concepts including VPC design, traffic flow, security, connectivity, monitoring, and private service access.

Each project builds on the previous one, forming a complete cloud networking foundation aligned with cloud engineering and cloud security roles.

## Project Index

### 1. Cloud Networking Foundations
- **AWS Networking Introduction**  
  Fundamentals of cloud networking and AWS VPC concepts.

### 2. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- **Build a Virtual Private Cloud**  
  Created a custom VPC with CIDR blocks, subnets, and routing.

### 3. VPC Traffic Flow & Security
- **VPC Traffic Flow and Security**  
  Configured route tables, security groups, and network ACLs.

### 4. Private Subnets
- **Creating a Private Subnet**  
  Designed private subnets with restricted routing and dedicated ACLs.

### 5. Launching Compute in a VPC
- **Launching VPC Resources**  
  Deployed EC2 instances into public and private subnets with SSH access controls.

### 6. VPC Connectivity Testing
- **Testing VPC Connectivity**  
  Verified internal and external connectivity using ping, curl, and troubleshooting techniques.

### 7. VPC Peering
- **VPC Peering**  
  Connected multiple VPCs using peering connections and validated private cross-VPC traffic.

### 8. VPC Monitoring
- **VPC Monitoring with Flow Logs**  
  Enabled VPC Flow Logs and analyzed traffic using CloudWatch Logs Insights.

### 9. Accessing S3 from a VPC
- **Access S3 from a VPC**  
  Used EC2 and the AWS CLI to securely access Amazon S3.

### 10. VPC Endpoints
- **VPC Endpoints**  
  Implemented S3 Gateway Endpoints and enforced private access using bucket and endpoint policies.
