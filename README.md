## Overview

This repository serves as a master index for my AWS Networking projects completed through the **NextWork** learning series.  
Each project builds on the previous one, forming a complete cloud networking foundation aligned with cloud engineering and cloud security roles.

The portfolio focuses on **design, implementation, testing, troubleshooting, and monitoring** of AWS network infrastructure.

## Why This Portfolio Matters

Cloud networking is foundational to cloud engineering, DevOps, and cloud security roles.  
These projects demonstrate not just configuration, but **understanding, validation, and troubleshooting** of secure cloud networks.

This portfolio reflects real AWS networking scenarios and production-style best practices.
